UID wrapper library
====================

This library intercepts seteuid and related calls, and simulates them
in a manner similar to the nss_wrapper and socket_wrapper libraries.

This allows you to do user switching when testing e.g. file servers.

To use it set the following environment variables:

LD_PRELOAD=libuid_wrapper.so
UID_WRAPPER=1
